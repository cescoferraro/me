      <description>Basic Play Framework gradle configuration. It uses 4 plugins. Play plugin needs the java one. The other 2 are IDE specific.
apply plugin: &#39;java&#39; apply plugin: &#39;play&#39; apply plugin: &#39;idea&#39; apply plugin: &#39;eclipse&#39;  Where the play plugins lives!
repositories { mavenCentral() jcenter() maven { name &amp;quot;typesafe-maven-release&amp;quot; url &amp;quot;https://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/maven-releases&amp;quot; } ivy { name &amp;quot;typesafe-ivy-release&amp;quot; url &amp;quot;https://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/ivy-releases&amp;quot; layout &amp;quot;ivy&amp;quot; } }  The dependencies of the project.
Note the some of them are duplicates because Eclipse could not find the play dependencie at the classpath</description>

      <description>I have been coding a lot for the past two years. And by crazy I mean at least a little bit everyday, but often all my spare time. Not usually for work, except for a few freelance jobs I have successfully landed, but for FUN. Yes, coding is awesome and I will explain why. I currently work as a on-site Civil Engineer. I have studied quite a bit to get where I am, but the job has become very repetitive with very few new things to learn.</description>

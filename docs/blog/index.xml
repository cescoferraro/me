      <description>Yeah ❤️, I got hooked. Everytime I think about coding any server side code, I immediatly think about that little gopher running around. My brain works in Go, I cant help it. So as my first code post I thought it would be a good idea to show you guys how I deal with websockets, since its the main reason I left Python(Flask/Django), Its lack of official support, leave the job to heros like Miguel Grinberg</description>

      <description>I have been coding a lot for the past two years. And by crazy I mean at least a lil bit everyday, but often all my spare time. Not usually for work, except for a few freelance jobs I have successfully landed, but for FUN. Yes, coding is awesome and I will explain why. I currently work as a on-site Civil Engineer. I have studied quite a bit to get where I am, but the job has become very repetitive with very few new things to learn.</description>

      <description>I have been coding a lot for the past two years. And by crazy I mean at least a little bit everyday, but often all my spare time. Not usually for work, except for a few freelance jobs I have successfully landed, but for FUN. Yes, coding is awesome and I will explain why. I currently work as a on-site Civil Engineer. I have studied quite a bit to get where I am, but the job has become very repetitive with very few new things to learn.</description>

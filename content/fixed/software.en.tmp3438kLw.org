* Professional Summary

#+BEGIN_QUOTE


I started off as a Civil Engineer, but felt in love with coding. I am pursing a career in this area in order to constantly engage myself with more complex problems. 
I grow up with the Internet, so that my primary focus as a developer. I really want to help it evolve as much as I can, so maybe I can pay off all the acknowledgment and fun it gave me. Have been a Linux user for 10+ years.
